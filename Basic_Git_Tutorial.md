## Branches

Branches are a way to work on code yourself without affecting the main codebase. All group members need to create a branch for themselves. I have called my branch "diarmaid's-branch". I think this is a good way of making it clear who's code is who.

### Step 1

Open the main code section of the project and click on the button that tells you how many branches there are (where the mouse is clicking in the below pictured)
