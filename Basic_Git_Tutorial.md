## Branches

Branches are a way to work on code yourself without affecting the main codebase. All group members need to create a branch for themselves. I have called my branch "diarmaid's-branch". I think this is a good way of making it clear who's code is who.

### Step 1

Open the main code section of the project and click on the button that tells you how many branches there are (where the mouse is clicking in the below pictured)

### Step 2

You should now be on a new menu that shows you all the branches. Next you want to click on the "New Branch" option.

### Step 3

Now just enter the name for your branch and make sure it's source is the main branch. Then hit "create new branch" and its done.

Now whenever you commit your code, it will first be committed to your branch. Then, once you are sure that your code is ready to be added to the main project, you can submit a pull request (covered down below). 

## Github Desktop

You should download Github Desktop as it is the best visualiser for committing and managing your code. The link to download the app is [here](https://desktop.github.com/ 'github desktop link').
