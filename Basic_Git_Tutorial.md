## Branches

Branches are a way to work on code yourself without affecting the main codebase. All group members need to create a branch for themselves. I have called my branch "diarmaid's-branch". I think this is a good way of making it clear who's code is who.

### Step 1

Open the main code section of the project and click on the button that tells you how many branches there are (where the mouse is clicking in the below pictured)

### Step 2

You should now be on a new menu that shows you all the branches. Next you want to click on the "New Branch" option.

### Step 3

Now just enter the name for your branch and make sure it's source is the main branch. Then hit "create new branch" and its done.

Now whenever you commit your code, it will first be committed to your branch. Then, once you are sure that your code is ready to be added to the main project, you can submit a pull request (covered down below). 

## Github Desktop

You should download Github Desktop as it is the best visualiser for committing and managing your code. The link to download the app is [here](https://desktop.github.com/ 'github desktop link'). Once you download the app, log in to your github account. After that you can choose a repository to download on to your local computer. Pick the "clone repository" option and the project should come up as an option under the "your repos" tab. Click on the project, then choose a location on your computer to store the repo(sorry I don't have a picture for any of this).

Now you should be seeing a menu not unlike the one you see below (with the exception of the tab in blue, don't worry about that for now).

There are three main tabs on the top left of your screen. The "Current Repository" tab tells you what repo you are currently working on and gives you the option of switching to another repo if you like.

 Next to it, is the "Current Branch" tab. This will tell you what branch you are working on. **Important Note:** Make sure you are working on your own branch and not the main branch. Otherwise, any commits you make will be directly added to the main branch whitch could lead to a lot of bugs and breakages. 

 The final tab is useful if you are working on the project across multiple computers (i.e. you laptop and your pc). It will pull any changes made to the branch from the cloud and add them to your local files.
